Introduction
==========================================
In this workshop we will be working with human associated metagenomes, following all the bioinformatic steps beginning with read sequencing quality checking and ending with functional annotation of assembled contigs.
You will be asked to choose one dataset to work with throughout the entire workshop and in the end we will compare results among different groups.
The three datasets you can choose from is:

    - Skin metagenome
    - Tooth metagenome
    - Gut metagenome
