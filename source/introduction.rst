A presentation for this workshop is available here_.

Here is a link_ to the official homepage for the 2014 SciLifeLab workshop in metagenomics.

In this workshop we will be working with human associated metagenomes from the human microbiome project (HMP_), 
following all the bioinformatic steps beginning with read sequence quality checking and ending with functional 
annotation of assembled contigs. You will be asked to choose one dataset to work with throughout the entire workshop 
and in the end we will compare results among different groups.
The three datasets you can choose from is:

    - Skin metagenome
    - Tooth metagenome
    - Gut metagenome
