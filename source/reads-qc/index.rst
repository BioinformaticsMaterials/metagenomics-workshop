Quality Control
===================================
The first step of any sequencing project is to do quality control of your
reads and remove (trim) low quality bases from the end of the read. In
this exercise, you will work with Illumina data from the Human Microbiome
Project that has already been trimmed. We still want to check the quality
of reads, though.

In this part of the metagenomics workshop we will learn how to:

- Check the quality of your raw sequencing data
- Perform quality trimming using sickle

The workshop has the following exercises:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   fastqc
   qtrim

At least a basic knowledge of how to work with the command line is required
otherwise it will be very difficult to follow some of the examples. Have
fun!
